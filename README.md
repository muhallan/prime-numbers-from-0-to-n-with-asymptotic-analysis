# prime-numbers-from-0-to-n-with-asymptotic-analysis
A function that generates prime numbers from 0 to n with its asymptotic analysis

# The asymptotic analysis of that algorithm is:
>> Worst case scenario is when the number passed in is prime. Time complexity is O(sqrt(n))
>> Best case scenario is when the number can be divided by 2,3,5,7,9. The time complexity here is O(1).
